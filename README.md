HashFlog is a file-based credential vault designed to securely store user credentials. It uses SHA-256 for email IDs and bcrypt for password hashing. Each record is Fernet-encrypted, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected. The design includes an append-only log and a small index for O(1) look-ups, making it lightweight and efficient. This solution requires no database and operates with just two files, making it ideal for secure prototypes, IoT applications, and web apps.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Store email IDs using SHA-256 and passwords with bcrypt.
- **Fernet Encryption**: Each record is encrypted for added security.
- **Efficient Access**: An append-only log allows for quick retrieval.
- **No Database Required**: Works with just two files.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle millions of users.
- **Ideal for Prototypes**: Perfect for IoT and web applications.

## Installation

To get started with HashFlog, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Frost58531/HashFlog/releases). After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Extract the files.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run the installation script:

   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage

Using HashFlog is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can store and retrieve credentials.

### Storing Credentials

To store credentials, use the following command:

```bash
python hashflog.py store --email your_email@example.com --password your_password
```

### Retrieving Credentials

To retrieve stored credentials, use:

```bash
python hashflog.py retrieve --email your_email@example.com
```

### Command-Line Options

- `--email`: Specify the email ID.
- `--password`: Provide the password for storage.

## How It Works

HashFlog employs a simple yet effective architecture. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Credential Storage**: 
   - Email IDs are hashed using SHA-256.
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, which adds a salt for security.

2. **Encryption**: 
   - Each record is encrypted using Fernet, ensuring that even if files are accessed, the data remains unreadable.

3. **Log Structure**: 
   - An append-only log records each entry, allowing for easy tracking of changes.
   - A tiny index is maintained for O(1) look-ups, ensuring that retrieval is quick and efficient.

4. **File Management**: 
   - All data is stored in two files, making the system lightweight and easy to manage.
